# Overleaf Extension + Research assistant
- Store papers in vectorDB
- Node is paper, links are references to other papers
- LLM job:
    - finds relevant literature from variety of sources
    - Suggests:
        i) points metioned in other papers than you haven't mentioned
        ii) Misquotes/ misuse of papers?
        iii) Reads your own paper + sources, what do those papers reference? what papers also reference that topic?

- Goal:
    - reference map / graph
    - easier to research \/ do papers.
    - chatbot using RAG to answer questions with well cited answers, can quote papers

- Reach Goals:
    - ‘identifies gaps in the market’ simply by looking at the sketch/map and coming up with areas which are neglected 














Anthropic: Use claude
- Jury + RAG

MW:
- code path generator


Story linking and analysis
- Vector DB - intersystems
- find out which article is about the same news story (scrape and use rss feeds, link news stories, and how we do it)
- compile a list of rss fields
- use react, display a timeline of events and then have that event blow up so that it shows left and right views using news cards -> click on the card to access the news story
